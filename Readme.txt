Hello guys! thank you for viewing my project.

- This project is done as a part of my two month internship as a Data analyst in Unified Mentor. (UMIP21647)

- This is my first project. And i pretty much learnt the basics of data cleaning, EDA analysis and so on. 

- The original dataset is provided in the name of "Supermart Grocery Sales - Retail Analytics Dataset.csv"

- I have also included my Power BI file in the repository, Make sure you have Power BI installed in your system for viewing the file

- I have also included the .csv and .xlsx incase you need to create the visualizations using Tableau or Power BI

- The files with the filename 'modified' was cleaned by myself in python and exported by me. feel free to use those files

Thank you for your support
